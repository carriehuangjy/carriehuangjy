# Kiddivax Study
I am excited to share with you our research work from our Kiddivax Study. In 2008, we began a pilot study of 119 households in Hong Kong to evaluate the direct and indirect benefits of influenza vaccination. In the subsequent year, we continued with a main study of 796 households and followed up for 4 years. We collected demographics, vaccination information, respiratory and serum samples at various timepoints from children aged 5-14 years and their household members.
On this page (link provided), you will find the details of this study including the relevant datasets and R scripts for our publications. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any aspect of our research further, please do not hesitate to reach out.
